Identify the last available task number in BACKLOG.md and create a new markdown file in the `tasks/drafts` directory with the next sequential number (e.g., if the last task is 010, create 011). The file should be named in the format `tasks/drafts/XXX.task-name.md`, where `XXX` is the zero-padded task number and `task-name` is a kebab-case version of the task description.

Link this new draft task in the "Drafts" section of BACKLOG.md, ensuring that it is properly formatted and includes a link to the newly created markdown file. If a development plan is provided, create a corresponding plan file named `tasks/drafts/XXX.task-name.plan.md` and link it in the task markdown file. The task status should be set to "draft".

State consistency rule:
- the task must appear in exactly one BACKLOG section at a time
- for this skill, the task must be listed only under "Drafts"

BACKLOG link convention (mandatory):
- all links in `tasks/BACKLOG.md` must be relative to that file
- draft links must use `./drafts/...`
- ready links must use `./ready/...`
- completed links must use `./completed/...`
- root in-progress task links must use `./XXX.task-name.md`
